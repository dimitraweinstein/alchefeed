    description: `Congratulations! You're most like Jeffrey "The Dude" Lebowski!
    The Dude is a middle-aged slacker, stoner dropout who wants nothing more than to listen to whale music in the bathtub while smoking a joint. He bowls in a league with his best friends, is unemployed, and his drink of choice is a White Russian, which he calls a Caucasian. He is described as a pacifist, and maintains an even-keeled if somewhat out-of-it attitude throughout the events he endures. He is at heart an affable and relaxed man, a lovable antihero who is quick to forgive and just wants to have a relaxed time.`,

    image: `./assets/lebowski/donnie.jpg`,
    description: `Congratulations! You're most like Theodore Donald Kerabatsos! 
    Donny is the third friend in the Dude's trio. He is far more meek than Walter, but comes on the adventures with the other two, often the butt of Walter's abuse. He dies of a heart attack during the struggle with the nihilists at the end.`,

    image: `./assets/lebowski/WalterSobchak.webp`,
    description: `Congratulations! You're most like Walter Sobchak!
    Walter is one of the Dude's best friends and they bowl together in a weekly league. Walter is a Vietnam War veteran who is one step away from coming unhinged, combustible and easily angered. While helping the Dude solve the mystery of Bunny's disappearance, he often proves to be more of a liability than a help, making matters much worse than when they began. He is violent and impassioned, a comic foil to the Dude's more relaxed mentality.`,

    image: `./assets/lebowski/bunny.jpg`,
    description: `Congratulations! You're most like Bunny Lebowski!
    Bunny is Jeffrey Lebowski's much younger wife. A porn star who owes a lot of money to a porn producer, she skips town to drive her red convertible around and live the free life. Maude Lebowski, Jeffrey Lebowski's daughter, describes her as a nymphomaniac.`,

description: `Congratulations! You're most like Jesus Quintana! 'The Jesus' is the opponent of The Dude's bowling team and did six months in Chino for exposing himself to an 8 year old. He speaks with a thick Cuban American accent and refers to himself as "The Jesus". Walter calls him a "pederast".`,
