Sometimes he does get a bit moody and says that the progress of the Museum has not changed much since there is only one staff member on the Museum - him. Besides that, he is a very talkative owl.`

He will call you a member of the family as soon as you join him and is eager to start showing you around. He is a good salesman, always telling characters how great his products are and how you might never see another like it, but in reality most of the stuff that he sells can be found at Nook's.`
