            I am interested in creating apps and supporting companies, startups,
            etc. that have a mission-driven mindset to effect positive change in
            their local communities and abroad. I am passionate about developing
            and providing solutions to everyday problems, and finding ways to
            give access to resources for those who are marginalized, overlooked,
            and discounted. I desire to use my coding experience to help people
            achieve their goals.

            I'm a Full-stack Web Developer and USMC Vet in Arizona. I wanted to
            learn more about coding when I started learning about making games,
            and I've wanted to do it professionally ever since. When I'm not
            coding, I like to learn more about game coding.
